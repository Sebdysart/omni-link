## What it does

omni-link scans up to 4 repositories, builds an ecosystem graph of API contracts, shared types, and cross-repo dependencies, then injects a compact context digest into every Claude Code session. It enforces quality gates that **block** hallucinated imports, wrong conventions, and placeholder code -- and proactively surfaces business evolution opportunities backed by codebase evidence.

## Features

- **Multi-repo scanning** -- Tree-sitter-powered parsing of TypeScript, Swift, Python, Go, Rust, Java, and JavaScript
- **API contract mapping** -- Detects routes, tRPC procedures, and consumer references across repos
- **Type lineage tracking** -- Finds shared concepts (e.g., `User` in backend, `UserDTO` in iOS) via name matching and field similarity
- **Contract mismatch detection** -- Identifies breaking, warning, and info-level type divergences
- **Context digest** -- Token-budgeted markdown summary injected at session start
- **Anti-slop gate** -- Blocks hallucinated imports, unknown packages, wrong conventions, and placeholder code
- **Convention enforcement** -- Detects and enforces naming, file organization, error handling, and testing patterns
- **Evolution engine** -- Gap analysis, bottleneck detection, competitive benchmarking, and ranked upgrade proposals
- **Impact analysis** -- Traces ripple effects of changes across the entire ecosystem
- **Health scoring** -- Per-repo and overall ecosystem health metrics

## Skills

Skills are contextual instructions that guide Claude Code's behavior within the omni-link ecosystem.

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `using-omni-link` | Session start | Meta skill defining iron laws, skill registry, and aggressive evolution posture |
| `ecosystem-grounding` | Session start, after rescan | Ground Claude in current ecosystem state: repos, contracts, mismatches |
| `anti-slop-gate` | Code generation | Block hallucinated imports, unknown packages, wrong conventions, placeholder code |
| `convention-enforcer` | Code generation | Enforce naming, file organization, error handling, and testing conventions |
| `cross-repo-impact` | Before API/schema changes | Analyze ripple effects of changes across all configured repositories |
| `dependency-navigator` | On demand | Trace dependency chains, answer "Where is X used?" across repos |
| `ecosystem-planner` | Multi-repo feature planning | Plan task ordering, coordination points, and contract validation checkpoints |
| `health-audit` | On demand | Produce per-repo and overall health scores with actionable recommendations |
| `business-evolution` | Session start, `/evolve` | Surface business improvement opportunities backed by codebase evidence |
| `upgrade-executor` | Multi-repo changes | Orchestrate provider-first ordering, contract validation, and rollback planning |

## Commands

Commands are slash commands available in Claude Code.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/scan` | Force a full ecosystem rescan across all configured repos |
| `/impact` | Analyze cross-repo impact of uncommitted changes |
| `/health` | Run a full ecosystem health audit with per-repo scores |
| `/evolve` | Generate ranked evolution suggestions with evidence |

## Agents

Specialized agents for focused analysis tasks.

|-------|-------------|
| `repo-analyst` | Deep-dive single-repo analysis: structure, dependencies, dead code, test coverage, health |
| `cross-repo-reviewer` | Reviews changes for cross-repo safety: API contracts, type lineage, dependency compatibility |
| `evolution-strategist` | CTO/product strategist perspective: industry best practices, competitive analysis, strategic roadmaps |

## Architecture

omni-link is built as a layered pipeline:

```
.omni-link.json
     |
     v
+-----------+     +----------+     +---------+     +-----------+     +----------+
|  Scanner  | --> | Grapher  | --> | Context | --> |  Quality  | --> | Evolution|
+-----------+     +----------+     +---------+     +-----------+     +----------+
```

### Engine layers

1. **Scanner** (`engine/scanner/`) -- Tree-sitter-powered parsing that walks each repo and extracts exports, routes, tRPC procedures, types, schemas, conventions, dependencies, and git state into a `RepoManifest`.

2. **Grapher** (`engine/grapher/`) -- Cross-repo analysis that builds an `EcosystemGraph` from all manifests: API bridges (provider/consumer connections), type lineage (shared concepts across repos), contract mismatches, dependency graphs, and impact paths.

3. **Context** (`engine/context/`) -- Token-budgeted context generation: prunes the ecosystem graph to fit within the configured token budget, formats a human-readable digest, and manages scan caching.

4. **Quality** (`engine/quality/`) -- Enforcement layer with four gates: reference checker (validates imports and symbols), convention validator (naming, organization, patterns), slop detector (placeholder code, hallucinations), and health scorer (per-repo and overall scores).

5. **Evolution** (`engine/evolution/`) -- Business intelligence: gap analyzer (incomplete CRUD, dead exports, orphaned schemas), bottleneck finder (pagination, caching, rate-limiting), competitive benchmarker (best practices comparison), and upgrade proposer (ranked suggestions with evidence).

### Key types

- `RepoManifest` -- Complete snapshot of a single repo's code structure
- `EcosystemGraph` -- Cross-repo relationship graph with bridges, types, and mismatches
- `EcosystemDigest` -- Token-budgeted summary for session injection
- `EvolutionSuggestion` -- Ranked improvement proposal with evidence and effort estimates

## Compatibility

omni-link works alongside Claude Code Superpowers and other plugins without conflicts. It operates through standard plugin extension points (skills, commands, agents, hooks) and does not modify Claude Code's core behavior.
